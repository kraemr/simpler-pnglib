# simpler-pnglib
is a rewrite of my simple-pnglib in c which will be faster and simpler to use

# How to use

First clone the repo with submodule
```git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/kraemr/simpler-pnglib/.git´´´


Then cd into it
```cd simpler-pnglib

Then execute either setup_linux.sh or setup_windows.bat
The resulting static libraries will be in the build folder

Then you will need to include the .h files in include in your .c or .cpp files to use the library and of course you will need to link with them as well
